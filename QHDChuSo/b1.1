Many people believe that it's better to learn somethong in a group rather than individually. I totally agree with this statement since it can eliminate procastination, improve learning productivity and develop communication skills  

Firslt, learning in group can eliminate the procastination. Usually, students tend to postpone and lose self-dispcipline when they are studying alone. They don't have enough determination and delay their learning progress in a very long time. Learning in group can help them maintain their self-study ability as long as their persistence of looking for knowledge. As a result, we can get in the habit of learning every day and break the habit of delaying gradually. This is because, learning in group creates an environment of responsibility, where each members will support the motivation and help their friends stay focus on the road of seek knowledge. For example, when learning with my friends, I actually want keep up with them. Therefore, I have to learn much more than when I am learning alone.

In addition, learning in group can improve learning productivity. If we learn with our friends or teammates, we are most likely to interact and support each other. This is the main reason that learning in group can enhance the productivity since each person would explore one or two different lessions at home and share their understanding with others. What's more, in many cases, we can't understand the problems which our teacher explains as easy as our friends do, maybe because the different in experience, understanding between teachers and students. We can exchange with our friends about some piece of knowledge which we don't understand clearly. During the discussion, explaining ideas also help you remember the lession better. For instance, teachers often divide class into many groups, ask them to explore the new lessions and present their understanding in front of class tomorrow. This is one of the most common method to improve the student's learning speed at school 

Finally, learning in group can develop communication skills. Communication is the key to success. Group study allows students to interact and communicate with other students easily. If engaged sincerely, it can improve our communication skilss to a great level. When students pariticpate in a group, they work together to find the solutions for a problems (assignments, projects...). This teaches them how to work in group and interact with teammates. To say you what I mean, I am an introvert at first. However, after joining my schol Study Department Club and go through a lot of self-study sessions, from small to big projects and assignments. I feel much more confident in exchanging ideas and expressing emotions with others. This has made a big impact on me. 

In conclusion, although studying also brings a lot of advantages, I state that learning in group is the better way to achive success because it can eliminate procastination, improve productivity and develop communication skills. Therefore, learning in group will bring us more benefits.
